# About Me 👋

My name is [John Paulo Mataac](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cyberpau/), and I'm a self-thought full stack developer with passion for Digital Innovations, DevSecOps, Tech Communities and Startups.

My favorite word is * **FREE** *, that's why I love anything that's free, including:
- Open-source applications
- Free seminars / trainings / certifications
- Freebies / Swags from events and tech communities
- Free discounts and online vouchers
- Freedom to create, innovate and change the world 🌍

Hobbies includes reading Manga / Manhua, investing on startups, stocks and NFTs, attending webinars and meetups, learning new techs, watching movies / animes (post-apocalyptic, supernatural, adventure genre)


# Tech Stack ⚡

As much as I'd like to specialize at one field, I'm not lucky enough to land the same role on each of my employment. However, I'm still thankful to have a broad and connected range of IT skills to backup my passion for technology and digital innovations.
