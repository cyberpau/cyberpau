# About Me ðŸ‘‹

I'm a self-thought full stack developer with passion for Digital Innovations, DevSecOps, Tech Communities, Startups, EdTech and FinTech.

My favorite word is **FREE**, that's why I love anything that's free, including:
- Open-source softwares
- Free seminars / trainings / certifications
- Free foods / vouchers / swags
- **FREE**dom to innovate and express ideas and thoughts.
