# About Me 👋

My name is John Paulo Mataac, and I'm a self-thought full stack developer with passion for Digital Innovations, DevSecOps, Tech Communities and Startups.

My favorite word is * **FREE** *, that's why I love anything that's free, including:
- Open-source applications
- Free seminars / trainings / certifications
- Freebies / Swags
- Free discounts / vouchers / coupons
- **FREE**dom to innovate and express ideas and thoughts.

Hobbies includes reading Manga / Manhua, investing on startups, attending tech webinars and meetups, watching movies / animes (post-apocalyptic, supernatural, adventure genre)
