# About Me ğŸ‘‹

My name is [John Paulo Mataac](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cyberpau/), and I'm a self-thought full stack developer with passion for Digital Innovations, DevSecOps, Tech Communities and Startups.

My favorite word is * **FREE** *, that's why I love anything that's free, including:
- Open-source applications
- Free seminars / trainings / certifications
- Freebies / Swags
- Free discounts / vouchers / coupons
- **FREE**dom to innovate and express ideas and thoughts.

Hobbies includes reading Manga / Manhua, investing on startups, attending tech webinars and meetups, watching movies / animes (post-apocalyptic, supernatural, adventure genre)


# Tech Stack âš¡

As much as I'd like to specialize at one field, I'm not lucky enough to land the same role on each of my employment. However, I'm still thankful to have a broad and connected range of IT skills to backup my passion for technology and digital innovations.
